- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julius also known as @Zottelchen.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in open source & self hosted applications. Trying to reduce certain companies impact on the internet, at least for myself.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently writing my bachelor thesis. Also looking for a new adventure. Maybe Rust. Or Kubernetes.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me a message on Discord (`zottelchen` there as well) (This section will be extended... as soon as I get around to setup a XMPP server. Or Matrix? Or an IRC bouncer? Not sure yet, but something else is coming.)
